            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Integration with Other Applications
The scanner outputs structured JSON, making it easy to integrate with other applications:

```powershell
# PowerShell example
$result = .\airpods_battery_cli_v5.exe | ConvertFrom-Json
foreach ($device in $result.devices) {
    Write-Host "$($device.model): L:$($device.airpods_data.left_battery)% R:$($device.airpods_data.right_battery)% C:$($device.airpods_data.case_battery)%"
}
```

```python
# Python example
import subprocess
import json

result = subprocess.run(['airpods_battery_cli_v5.exe'], capture_output=True, text=True)
data = json.loads(result.stdout)

for device in data['devices']:
    airpods = device['airpods_data']
    print(f"{device['model']}: L:{airpods['left_battery']}% R:{airpods['right_battery']}% C:{airpods['case_battery']}%")
```

## Architecture

The CLI scanner features a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **BLE Scanner Module** (`Source/ble/`)
   - `IBleScanner.hpp`: Abstract interface for BLE scanning
   - `WinRtBleScanner.cpp`: Windows Runtime BLE implementation
   - `BleDevice.hpp/cpp`: Device data structures and utilities

2. **Protocol Parser Module** (`Source/protocol/`)
   - `IProtocolParser.hpp`: Template interface for protocol parsers
   - `AppleContinuityParser.cpp`: Apple Continuity Protocol implementation
   - `AirPodsData.hpp/cpp`: Data structures for AirPods information

3. **Build System**
   - `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake configuration with modular targets
   - Static libraries: `protocol_parser.lib`, `ble_scanner.lib`
   - Test executables for validation

### Key Design Principles

- **Interface-based Design**: Clean abstractions for testability and extensibility
- **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for real-time operations
- **Resource Management**: RAII patterns for Bluetooth connections
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and user-friendly messages
- **Documentation**: Thorough code comments and API documentation

For detailed architecture information, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Supported Devices

## JSON Output Format

The scanner outputs structured JSON with the following schema:

```json
{
    "scanner_version": "string",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601 datetime",
    "devices": [
        {
            "device_id": "string (hex MAC address)",
            "device_name": "string (optional)",
            "model": "string (human-readable model name)",
            "model_id": "number (numeric model identifier)",
            "rssi": "number (signal strength in dBm)",
            "manufacturer_data": "string (hex-encoded raw data)",
            "airpods_data": {
                "left_battery": "number (0-100)",
                "right_battery": "number (0-100)",
                "case_battery": "number (0-100)",
                "left_charging": "boolean",
                "right_charging": "boolean", 
                "case_charging": "boolean",
                "left_in_ear": "boolean",

                "broadcasting_ear": "string (left|right|unknown)"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Devices Found
**Problem**: Scanner runs but reports no devices
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure AirPods are paired with the computer
2. Check Bluetooth adapter is enabled and functioning
3. Verify AirPods are not in deep sleep (use them briefly to wake up)
4. Try re-pairing the AirPods if necessary

#### Access Denied Errors
**Problem**: Permission errors when accessing Bluetooth
**Solutions**:
1. Run as Administrator (right-click → "Run as administrator")
2. Check Windows Privacy settings for Bluetooth access
3. Verify Bluetooth service is running (`services.msc` → Bluetooth Support Service)

#### Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Build fails with compiler errors
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ workload is installed
2. Verify Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0 or later is available
3. Check CMake version is 3.10 or later
4. Initialize git submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

#### Missing spdlog Dependencies
**Problem**: Build fails with spdlog-related errors
**Solutions**:
1. Initialize submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. Verify `third_party/spdlog/` directory exists and contains files
3. Clean and rebuild: `cmake --build build --target clean && cmake --build build --config Release`

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check Bluetooth adapter status
Get-PnpDevice -Class Bluetooth

# Verify BLE device enumeration
Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object {$_.FriendlyName -like "*AirPods*"}

# Test CLI scanner with verbose output
.\airpods_battery_cli_v5.exe 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath debug.log
```

### Debug Mode
The scanner includes comprehensive logging. Check console output for detailed information about:
- Bluetooth adapter detection
- Device enumeration process  
- Protocol parsing results
- Error conditions and recovery attempts
